codjo-documentation-migration
=============================

A dedicated environnement to manage Migration from confluence

This repository exists to report all documentation migration issues.

Feel free to add issues : https://github.com/codjo/codjo-documentation-migration/issues/new


Some simple rules:
check if the library has already been verified in the isues
PLEASE add a Tag with the library name on every issue
If there is no 'bug' please add an issue, close it with the correct tag so that the next one won't the work twice

If you are very powerfull, fix them ;-)


Thank you
